                            into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to
                            cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.

                        <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled
                            dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into
                            a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,
                            and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
                            brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches
                            into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to
                            cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
                            His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size
                            of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he
                            looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought.</p>
